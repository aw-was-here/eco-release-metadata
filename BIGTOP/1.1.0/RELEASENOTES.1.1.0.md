* [BIGTOP-2363](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BIGTOP-2363) | *Major* | **User Guide for version 1.1.0 is blank**

Hi Team,

The user guide for Bigtop 1.1.0 is pathetic. On the site, it just shows blank pages for any topic on contents.

http://bigtop.apache.org/book/apache-bigtop-user-guide/apache-bigtop-user-guide.html

Please look into the same.

Regards,
Sijee
