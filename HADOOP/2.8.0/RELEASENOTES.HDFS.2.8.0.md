---

* [HDFS-7933](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-7933) | *Major* | **fsck should also report decommissioning replicas.**

**WARNING: No release note provided for this incompatible change.**


---

* [HDFS-7501](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-7501) | *Major* | **TransactionsSinceLastCheckpoint can be negative on SBNs**

Fixed a bug where the StandbyNameNode's TransactionsSinceLastCheckpoint metric may slide into a negative number after every subsequent checkpoint.


---

* [HDFS-6666](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-6666) | *Minor* | **Abort NameNode and DataNode startup if security is enabled but block access token is not enabled.**

NameNode and DataNode now abort during startup if attempting to run in secure mode, but block access tokens are not enabled by setting configuration property dfs.block.access.token.enable to true in hdfs-site.xml.  Previously, this case logged a warning, because this would be an insecure configuration.
