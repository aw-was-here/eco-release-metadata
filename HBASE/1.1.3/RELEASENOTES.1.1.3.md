# Apache HBase  1.1.3 Release Notes

These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.


---

* [HBASE-14799](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14799) | *Critical* | **Commons-collections object deserialization remote command execution vulnerability**

This issue resolves a potential security vulnerability. For all versions we update our commons-collections dependency to the release that fixes the reported vulnerability in that library. In 0.98 we additionally disable by default a feature of code carried from 0.94 for backwards compatibility that is not needed.


---

* [HBASE-14605](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14605) | *Blocker* | **Split fails due to 'No valid credentials' error when SecureBulkLoadEndpoint#start tries to access hdfs**

When split is requested by non-super user, split related notifications for Coprocessor are executed using the login of the request user.
Previously the notifications were carried out as super user.


---

* [HBASE-14400](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14400) | *Critical* | **Fix HBase RPC protection documentation**

To use rpc protection in HBase, set the value of 'hbase.rpc.protection' to:
'authentication' : simple authentication using kerberos
'integrity' : authentication and integrity
'privacy' : authentication and confidentiality

Earlier, HBase reference guide erroneously mentioned in some places to set the value to 'auth-conf'. This patch fixes the guide and adds temporary support for erroneously recommended values.


---

* [HBASE-14313](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14313) | *Critical* | **After a Connection sees ConnectionClosingException it never recovers**

HConnection could get stuck when talking to a host that went down and then returned. This has been fixed by closing the connection in all paths.


---

* [HBASE-14280](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14280) | *Minor* | **Bulk Upload from HA cluster to remote HA hbase cluster fails**

Patch will effectively work with Hadoop version 2.6 or greater with a launch of "internal.nameservices".
There will be no change in versions older than 2.6.


---

* [HBASE-14261](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14261) | *Major* | **Enhance Chaos Monkey framework by adding zookeeper and datanode fault injections.**

This change augments existing chaos monkey framework with actions for restarting underlying zookeeper quorum and hdfs nodes of distributed hbase cluster. One assumption made while creating zk actions are that zookeper ensemble is an independent external service and won't be managed by hbase cluster.  For these actions to work as expected, the following parameters need to be configured appropriately.

{code}
\<property\>
  \<name\>hbase.it.clustermanager.hadoop.home\</name\>
  \<value\>$HADOOP\_HOME\</value\>
\</property\>
\<property\>
  \<name\>hbase.it.clustermanager.zookeeper.home\</name\>
  \<value\>$ZOOKEEPER\_HOME\</value\>
\</property\>
\<property\>
  \<name\>hbase.it.clustermanager.hbase.user\</name\>
  \<value\>hbase\</value\>
\</property\>
\<property\>
  \<name\>hbase.it.clustermanager.hadoop.hdfs.user\</name\>
  \<value\>hdfs\</value\>
\</property\>
\<property\>
  \<name\>hbase.it.clustermanager.zookeeper.user\</name\>
  \<value\>zookeeper\</value\>
\</property\>
{code}

The service user related configurations are newly introduced since in prod/test environments each service is managed by different user. Once the above parameters are configured properly, you can start using them as needed. An example usage for invoking these new actions is:

{{./hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.IntegrationTestAcidGuarantees -m serverAndDependenciesKilling}}


---

* [HBASE-14224](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14224) | *Critical* | **Fix coprocessor handling of duplicate classes**

Prevent Coprocessors being doubly-loaded; a particular coprocessor can only be loaded once.
