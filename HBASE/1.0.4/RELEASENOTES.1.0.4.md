* [HBASE-14799](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14799) | *Critical* | **Commons-collections object deserialization remote command execution vulnerability**

This issue resolves a potential security vulnerability. For all versions we update our commons-collections dependency to the release that fixes the reported vulnerability in that library. In 0.98 we additionally disable by default a feature of code carried from 0.94 for backwards compatibility that is not needed.
