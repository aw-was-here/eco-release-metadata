# Apache HBase  0.98.13 Release Notes

These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, features, and major improvements.


---

* [HBASE-13625](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13625) | *Major* | **Use HDFS for HFileOutputFormat2 partitioner's path**

Introduces a new config hbase.fs.tmp.dir which is a directory in HDFS (or default file system) to use as a staging directory for HFileOutputFormat2.


---

* [HBASE-13564](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13564) | *Major* | **Master MBeans are not published**

To use the coprocessor-based JMX implementation provided by HBase for Master.
Add below property in hbase-site.xml file: 

<property>
  <name>hbase.coprocessor.master.classes</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.JMXListener</value>
</property>

NOTE: DO NOT set `com.sun.management.jmxremote.port` for Java VM at the same time.

By default, the JMX listens on TCP port 10101 for Master, we can further configure the port using below properties:

<property>
  <name>master.rmi.registry.port</name>
  <value>61110</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>master.rmi.connector.port</name>
  <value>61120</value>
</property>
----

The registry port can be shared with connector port in most cases, so you only need to configure master.rmi.registry.port.
However if you want to use SSL communication, the 2 ports must be configured to different values.

* [HBASE-13494](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13494) | *Major* | **0.98: Remove remove(K, V) from type PoolMap\<K,V\>**

This removes PoolMap.remove(K key, V value).
Callers using this method must use PoolMap.removeValue(K key, V value) instead.


---

* [HBASE-11658](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11658) | *Major* | **Piped commands to hbase shell should return non-zero if shell command failed.**

Adds a noninteractive mode (-n or --noninteractive) to the hbase shell that exits with a non-zero error code on failed or invalid shell command executions, and exits with a zero error code upon successful execution.
