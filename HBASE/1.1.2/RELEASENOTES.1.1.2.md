# Apache HBase  1.1.2 Release Notes

These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, features, and major improvements.


---

* [HBASE-14054](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14054) | *Major* | **Acknowledged writes may get lost if regionserver clock is set backwards**

In {{checkAndPut}} write path use max(max timestamp for the row, System.currentTimeMillis()) in the, instead of blindly taking System.currentTimeMillis() to ensure that checkAndPut() cannot do writes which is already eclipsed. This is similar to what has been done in HBASE-12449 for increment and append.

* [HBASE-13983](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13983) | *Minor* | **Doc how the oddball HTable methods getStartKey, getEndKey, etc. will be removed in 2.0.0**

Adds extra doc on getStartKeys, getEndKeys, and getStartEndKeys in HTable explaining that they will be removed in 2.0.0 (these methods did not get the proper full major version deprecation cycle).

In this issue, we actually also remove these methods in master/2.0.0 branch.


---

* [HBASE-13966](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13966) | *Minor* | **Limit column width in table.jsp**

Wraps region, start key, end key columns if too long.


---

* [HBASE-13959](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13959) | *Critical* | **Region splitting uses a single thread in most common cases**

The performance of region splitting has been improved by using a thread pool to split the store files concurrently. Prior to this change, the store files were always split sequentially in a single thread, so a region with multiple store files ended up taking several seconds. The thread pool is sized dynamically with the aim of getting maximum concurrency, without exceeding the number of cores available for HBase Java process. A lower limit for the thread pool can be explicitly set using the property hbase.regionserver.region.split.threads.max.

* [HBASE-13930](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13930) | *Major* | **Exclude Findbugs packages from shaded jars**

Exclude Findbugs packages from shaded jars


---

* [HBASE-13881](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13881) | *Major* | **Bug in HTable#incrementColumnValue implementation**

HBASE-13881 Correct HTable incrementColumnValue implementation


---

* [HBASE-13865](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13865) | *Trivial* | **Increase the default value for hbase.hregion.memstore.block.multipler from 2 to 4 (part 2)**

Increase default hbase.hregion.memstore.block.multiplier from 2 to 4 in the code to match the default value in the config files.


---

* [HBASE-13127](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13127) | *Major* | **Add timeouts on all tests so less zombie sightings**

Use junit facility to impose timeout on test. Use test category to chose which timeout to apply: small tests timeout after 30 seconds, medium tests after 180 seconds, and large tests after ten minutes.

Updated junit version from 4.11 to 4.12. 4.12 has support for feature used here.


---

* [HBASE-10844](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-10844) | *Major* | **Coprocessor failure during batchmutation leaves the memstore datastructs in an inconsistent state**

Promotes an -ea assert to logged FATAL and RS abort when memstore is found to be in an inconsistent state.
