<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-9902">HADOOP-9902</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Shell script rewrite</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- markdown -->
<p>The Hadoop shell scripts have been rewritten to fix many long standing bugs and include some new features. While an eye has been kept towards compatibility, some changes may break existing installations.</p>
<p>INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:</p>
<ul>
<li>The pid and out files for secure daemons have been renamed to include the appropriate ${HADOOP_IDENT_STR}. This should allow, with proper configurations in place, for multiple versions of the same secure daemon to run on a host. Additionally, pid files are now created when daemons are run in interactive mode. This will also prevent the accidental starting of two daemons with the same configuration prior to launching java (i.e., &quot;fast fail&quot; without having to wait for socket opening).</li>
<li>All Hadoop shell script subsystems now execute hadoop-env.sh, which allows for all of the environment variables to be in one location. This was not the case previously.</li>
<li>The default content of *-env.sh has been significantly altered, with the majority of defaults moved into more protected areas inside the code. Additionally, these files do not auto-append anymore; setting a variable on the command line prior to calling a shell command must contain the entire content, not just any extra settings. This brings Hadoop more in-line with the vast majority of other software packages.</li>
<li>All HDFS_*, YARN_*, and MAPRED_* environment variables act as overrides to their equivalent HADOOP_* environment variables when 'hdfs', 'yarn', 'mapred', and related commands are executed. Previously, these were separated out which meant a significant amount of duplication of common settings.<br />
</li>
<li>hdfs-config.sh and hdfs-config.cmd were inadvertently duplicated into libexec and sbin. The sbin versions have been removed.</li>
<li>The log4j settings forcibly set by some *-daemon.sh commands have been removed. These settings are now configurable in the *-env.sh files via *_OPT.</li>
<li>Support for various undocumented YARN log4j.properties files has been removed.</li>
<li>Support for ${HADOOP_MASTER} and the related rsync code have been removed.</li>
<li>The undocumented and unused yarn.id.str Java property has been removed.</li>
<li>The unused yarn.policy.file Java property has been removed.</li>
<li>We now require bash v3 (released July 27, 2004) or better in order to take advantage of better regex handling and ${BASH_SOURCE}. POSIX sh will not work.</li>
<li>Support for --script has been removed. We now use ${HADOOP_*_PATH} or ${HADOOP_PREFIX} to find the necessary binaries. (See other note regarding ${HADOOP_PREFIX} auto discovery.)</li>
<li>Non-existent classpaths, ld.so library paths, JNI library paths, etc, will be ignored and stripped from their respective environment settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>NEW FEATURES:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daemonization has been moved from *-daemon.sh to the bin commands via the --daemon option. Simply use --daemon start to start a daemon, --daemon stop to stop a daemon, and --daemon status to set $? to the daemon's status. The return code for status is LSB-compatible. For example, 'hdfs --daemon start namenode'.</li>
<li>It is now possible to override some of the shell code capabilities to provide site specific functionality without replacing the shipped versions. Replacement functions should go into the new hadoop-user-functions.sh file.</li>
<li>A new option called --buildpaths will attempt to add developer build directories to the classpath to allow for in source tree testing.</li>
<li>Operations which trigger ssh connections can now use pdsh if installed. ${HADOOP_SSH_OPTS} still gets applied.</li>
<li>Added distch and jnipath subcommands to the hadoop command.</li>
<li>Shell scripts now support a --debug option which will report basic information on the construction of various environment variables, java options, classpath, etc. to help in configuration debugging.</li>
</ul>
<p>BUG FIXES:</p>
<ul>
<li>${HADOOP_CONF_DIR} is now properly honored everywhere, without requiring symlinking and other such tricks.</li>
<li>${HADOOP_CONF_DIR}/hadoop-layout.sh is now documented with a provided hadoop-layout.sh.example file.</li>
<li>Shell commands should now work properly when called as a relative path, without ${HADOOP_PREFIX} being defined, and as the target of bash -x for debugging. If ${HADOOP_PREFIX} is not set, it will be automatically determined based upon the current location of the shell library. Note that other parts of the extended Hadoop ecosystem may still require this environment variable to be configured.</li>
<li>Operations which trigger ssh will now limit the number of connections to run in parallel to ${HADOOP_SSH_PARALLEL} to prevent memory and network exhaustion. By default, this is set to 10.</li>
<li>${HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS} support has been added to a few more commands.</li>
<li>Some subcommands were not listed in the usage.</li>
<li>Various options on hadoop command lines were supported inconsistently. These have been unified into hadoop-config.sh. --config is still required to be first, however.</li>
<li>ulimit logging for secure daemons no longer assumes /bin/bash but does assume bash is on the command line path.</li>
<li>Removed references to some Yahoo! specific paths.</li>
<li>Removed unused slaves.sh from YARN build tree.</li>
<li>Many exit states have been changed to reflect reality.</li>
<li>Shell level errors now go to STDERR. Before, many of them went incorrectly to STDOUT.</li>
<li>CDPATH with a period (.) should no longer break the scripts.</li>
<li>The scripts no longer try to chown directories.</li>
<li>If ${JAVA_HOME} is not set on OS X, it now properly detects it instead of throwing an error.</li>
</ul>
<p>IMPROVEMENTS:</p>
<ul>
<li>The *.out files are now appended instead of overwritten to allow for external log rotation.</li>
<li>The style and layout of the scripts is much more consistent across subprojects.<br />
</li>
<li>More of the shell code is now commented.</li>
<li>Significant amounts of redundant code have been moved into a new file called hadoop-functions.sh.</li>
<li>The various *-env.sh have been massively changed to include documentation and examples on what can be set, ramifications of setting, etc. for all variables that are expected to be set by a user.<br />
</li>
<li>There is now some trivial de-duplication and sanitization of the classpath and JVM options. This allows, amongst other things, for custom settings in *_OPTS for Hadoop daemons to override defaults and other generic settings (i.e., ${HADOOP_OPTS}). This is particularly relevant for Xmx settings, as one can now set them in _OPTS and ignore the heap specific options for daemons which force the size in megabytes.</li>
<li>Subcommands have been alphabetized in both usage and in the code.</li>
<li>All/most of the functionality provided by the sbin/* commands has been moved to either their bin/ equivalents or made into functions. The rewritten versions of these commands are now wrappers to maintain backward compatibility.</li>
<li>Usage information is given with the following options/subcommands for all scripts using the common framework: --? -? ? --help -help -h help</li>
<li>Several generic environment variables have been added to provide a common configuration for pids, logs, and their security equivalents. The older versions still act as overrides to these generic versions.</li>
<li>Groundwork has been laid to allow for custom secure daemon setup using something other than jsvc (e.g., pfexec on Solaris).</li>
<li>Scripts now test and report better error messages for various states of the log and pid dirs on daemon startup. Before, unprotected shell errors would be displayed to the user.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-11041">HADOOP-11041</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>VersionInfo output specifies subversion</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This changes the output of the 'hadoop version' command to generically say 'Source code repository' rather than specify which type of repo.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-5972">MAPREDUCE-5972</a> | <em>Trivial</em> | <strong>Fix typo 'programatically' in job.xml (and a few other places)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Fix a typo. If a configuration is set through program, the source of the configuration is set to 'programmatically' instead of 'programatically' now.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-2841">MAPREDUCE-2841</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Task level native optimization</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Adds a native implementation of the map output collector. The native library will build automatically with -Pnative. Users may choose the new collector on a job-by-job basis by setting mapreduce.job.map.output.collector.class=org.apache.hadoop.mapred. nativetask.NativeMapOutputCollectorDelegator in their job configuration. For shuffle-intensive jobs this may provide speed-ups of 30% or more.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-11356">HADOOP-11356</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Removed deprecated o.a.h.fs.permission.AccessControlException</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>org.apache.hadoop.fs.permission.AccessControlException was deprecated in the last major release, and has been removed in favor of org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-10950">HADOOP-10950</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>rework heap management vars</strong></li>
</ul>
<!-- markdown -->
<ul>
<li><p>HADOOP_HEAPSIZE variable has been deprecated (It will still be honored if set, but expect it to go away in the future). In its place, HADOOP_HEAPSIZE_MAX and HADOOP_HEAPSIZE_MIN have been introduced to set Xmx and Xms, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>The internal variable JAVA_HEAP_MAX has been removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Default heap sizes have been removed. This will allow for the JVM to use auto-tuning based upon the memory size of the host. To re-enable the old default, configure HADOOP_HEAPSIZE_MAX=&quot;1g&quot; in hadoop-env.sh.</p></li>
<li><p>All global and daemon-specific heap size variables now support units. If the variable is only a number, the size is assumed to be in megabytes.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-11353">HADOOP-11353</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Add support for .hadooprc</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>.hadooprc allows users a convenient way to set and/or override the shell level settings.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-5785">MAPREDUCE-5785</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Derive heap size or mapreduce.*.memory.mb automatically</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The memory values for mapreduce.map/reduce.memory.mb keys, if left to their default values of -1, will now be automatically inferred from the heap size value system property (-Xmx) specified for mapreduce.map/reduce.java.opts keys.</p>
<p>The converse is also done, i.e. if mapreduce.map/reduce.memory.mb values are specified, but no -Xmx is supplied for mapreduce.map/reduce.java.opts keys, then the -Xmx value will be derived from the former's value.</p>
<p>If neither is specified, then a default value of 1024 MB gets used.</p>
<p>For both these conversions, a scaling factor specified by property mapreduce.job.heap.memory-mb.ratio is used, to account for overheads between heap usage vs. actual physical memory usage.</p>
<p>Existing configs or job code that already specify both the set of properties explicitly would not be affected by this inferring change.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-2428">YARN-2428</a> | <em>Trivial</em> | <strong>LCE default banned user list should have yarn</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The user 'yarn' is no longer allowed to run tasks for security reasons.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-11460">HADOOP-11460</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Deprecate shell vars</strong></li>

</ul>
<p>This change introduces a new configuration key used by RPC server to decide whether to send backoff signal to RPC Client when RPC call queue is full. When the feature is enabled, RPC server will no longer block on the processing of RPC requests when RPC call queue is full. It helps to improve quality of service when the service is under heavy load. The configuration key is in the format of &quot;ipc.#port#.backoff.enable&quot; where #port# is the port number that RPC server listens on. For example, if you want to enable the feature for the RPC server that listens on 8020, set ipc.8020.backoff.enable to true.</p>

<p>mapreduce.fileoutputcommitter.algorithm.version now defaults to 2.</p>
<p>In algorithm version 1:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>commitTask renames directory $joboutput/_temporary/$appAttemptID/_temporary/$taskAttemptID/ to $joboutput/_temporary/$appAttemptID/$taskID/</p></li>
<li><p>recoverTask renames $joboutput/_temporary/$appAttemptID/$taskID/ to $joboutput/_temporary/($appAttemptID + 1)/$taskID/</p></li>
<li><p>commitJob merges every task output file in $joboutput/_temporary/$appAttemptID/$taskID/ to $joboutput/, then it will delete $joboutput/_temporary/ and write $joboutput/_SUCCESS</p></li>
</ol>
<p>commitJob's run time, number of RPC, is O(n) in terms of output files, which is discussed in MAPREDUCE-4815, and can take minutes.</p>
<p>Algorithm version 2 changes the behavior of commitTask, recoverTask, and commitJob.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>commitTask renames all files in $joboutput/_temporary/$appAttemptID/_temporary/$taskAttemptID/ to $joboutput/</p></li>
<li><p>recoverTask is a nop strictly speaking, but for upgrade from version 1 to version 2 case, it checks if there are any files in $joboutput/_temporary/($appAttemptID - 1)/$taskID/ and renames them to $joboutput/</p></li>
<li><p>commitJob deletes $joboutput/_temporary and writes $joboutput/_SUCCESS</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Algorithm 2 takes advantage of task parallelism and makes commitJob itself O(1). However, the window of vulnerability for having incomplete output in $jobOutput directory is much larger. Therefore, pipeline logic for consuming job outputs should be built on checking for existence of _SUCCESS marker.</p>

</ul>
<!-- markdown -->
<p>HDFS now provides native support for erasure coding (EC) to store data more efficiently. Each individual directory can be configured with an EC policy with command <code>hdfs erasurecode -setPolicy</code>. When a file is created, it will inherit the EC policy from its nearest ancestor directory to determine how its blocks are stored. Compared to 3-way replication, the default EC policy saves 50% of storage space while also tolerating more storage failures.</p>
<p>To support small files, the currently phase of HDFS-EC stores blocks in <em>striped</em> layout, where a logical file block is divided into small units (64KB by default) and distributed to a set of DataNodes. This enables parallel I/O but also decreases data locality. Therefore, the cluster environment and I/O workloads should be considered before configuring EC policies.</p>

</ul>
<p>This release adds a new feature called the DataNode Lifeline Protocol. If configured, then DataNodes can report that they are still alive to the NameNode via a fallback protocol, separate from the existing heartbeat messages. This can prevent the NameNode from incorrectly marking DataNodes as stale or dead in highly overloaded clusters where heartbeat processing is suffering delays. For more information, please refer to the hdfs-default.xml documentation for several new configuration properties: dfs.namenode.lifeline.rpc-address, dfs.namenode.lifeline.rpc-bind-host, dfs.datanode.lifeline.interval.seconds, dfs.namenode.lifeline.handler.ratio and dfs.namenode.lifeline.handler.count.</p>

</ul>
<p>We are introducing an early preview (alpha 1) of a major revision of YARN Timeline Service: v.2. YARN Timeline Service v.2 addresses two major challenges: improving scalability and reliability of Timeline Service, and enhancing usability by introducing flows and aggregation.</p>
<p>YARN Timeline Service v.2 alpha 1 is provided so that users and developers can test it and provide feedback and suggestions for making it a ready replacement for Timeline Service v.1.x. It should be used only in a test capacity. Most importantly, security is not enabled. Do not set up or use Timeline Service v.2 until security is implemented if security is a critical requirement.</p>
<p>More details are available in the <a href="./hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/TimelineServiceV2.html">YARN Timeline Service v.2</a> documentation.</p>

</ul>
<p>Dependencies on commons-httpclient have been removed. Projects with undeclared transitive dependencies on commons-httpclient, previously provided via hadoop-common or hadoop-client, may find this to be an incompatible change. Such project are also potentially exposed to the commons-httpclient CVE, and should be fixed for that reason as well.</p>

</ul>
<p>Hdfs dfs chmod command will reset sticky bit permission on a file/directory when the leading sticky bit is omitted in the octal mode (like 644). So when a file/directory permission is applied using octal mode and sticky bit permission needs to be preserved, then it has to be explicitly mentioned in the permission bits (like 1644). This behavior is similar to many other filesystems on Linux/BSD.</p>

</ul>
<p>S3A has optimized the listFiles method by doing a bulk listing of all entries under a path in a single S3 operation instead of recursively walking the directory tree. The listLocatedStatus method has been optimized by fetching results from S3 lazily as the caller traverses the returned iterator instead of doing an eager fetch of all possible results.</p>
